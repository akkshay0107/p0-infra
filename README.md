This repository contains the infrastructure configuration for the p0 environment, including a local battle server, a custom login server, and a Caddy reverse proxy.

## Overview

- **ps-server**: A customized Pokemon Showdown server.
- **login**: A lightweight Express/LiteSQL server for handling user authentication and session assertions.
  - Supports `act=login`
  - Supports `act=changepassword` (requires `name`, `pass`, `newpass`)
  - Supports `act=changeusername` (requires `name`, `pass`, `newname`)
- **bot**: A reinforcement learning bot container.
- **caddy**: Reverse proxy for serving the client and routing traffic to the internal services.

## Prerequisites

This repository is designed to run within a specific directory structure. You must have the following sibling repositories cloned to your machine:

```text
.
├── p0-infra/        # (This repository)
├── p0/              # (https://github.com/akkshay0107/p0)
└── p0-client/       # (https://github.com/akkshay0107/p0-client)
```

Additionally you need **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed.

## Setup

1. **Env Variables**:
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # modify .env with your credentials as needed
   ```

2. **Generate Keys & Users**:
   Before starting the servers for the first time, you need to generate RSA keys for the login server and initialize the user database:
   ```bash
   cd login-server
   npm install
   node generate-keys.js
   node --env-file=../.env generate-users.js -n 250
   ```
   Hacky way right now to support around 250 participants. Will resolve this to a proper auth system with user creation later.

3. **Launch**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
